        "Neural networks are powerful tools, but they are **black-boxes**, meaning that it is difficult to provide human-understandable explanations on what they are doing. The field of **explanaibility** is concerned with finding algorithms for achieving this. In this homework, you will be guided in implementing some basic explanaibility algorithms (**saliency maps**), which is an instructive way of playing with the TensorFlow autodiff framework.\n",

Optional exercises are provided if you like the topic and would like to explore more; you are free to ignore them or complete as many as you want. I will not grade them but I might provide feedback for especially nice solutions.\n",
